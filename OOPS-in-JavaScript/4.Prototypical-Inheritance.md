# Prototypical Inheritance

We have a circle and square object in which both have the shape method as common so we can use the concept of inheritance to reuse the code.
  
ObjectBase <-- Shape <-- Circle.  
ObjectBase <-- Shape <-- Square.

Whenever we reset the prototype of an object, we should also reset the constructor, so here we should set ```circle.prototype.constructor``` to the circle constructor function. If not we cannot use new keyword to create objects.

```javascript
function Shape() {};

Shape.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate');
}

function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
}

// Prototypical inheritance
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;

Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
  console.log('draw');
}

const s = new Shape();
const c = new Circle();
```

## Calling Super Constructor

```javascript
function Shape(color) {
  this.color = color;
};

Shape.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate');
}

function Circle(radius, color) {
  Shape.call(this, color);
  this.radius = radius;
}

// Prototypical inheritance
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;

Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
  console.log('draw');
}

const s = new Shape();
const c = new Circle(1, 'red');
```

```javascript
function Rectangle(color) {
  // To call the super constructor
  Shape.call(this, color);
}
```

## Intermediate Function Inheritance

```javascript
function extend(Child, Parent) {
  Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
  Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
}

function Shape(color) {
  this.color = color;
};

function Circle(radius, color) {
  Shape.call(this, color);

  this.radius = radius;
}

extend(Circle, Shape);

Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
  console.log('draw');
}

function Square(size) {
  this.size = size;
}

const s = new Shape('red');
const c = new Circle(1, 'red');
```

## Method Overriding

Let's imagine this parent algorithm for duplicating a shape, works, or most of the shape object but maybe it should behave differently than circle objects. That's when we use method override.

So we override a method that is defined in the base object. JavaScript engine walks up the prototypical chain and picks the first implementation. So even in this hierarchy, we have implemented the duplicate method, both on the parent and child objects, the implementation on the child object will be used.

```javascript
function extend(Child, Parent) {
  Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
  Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
}

function Shape() {
}

Shape.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate');
}

function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
}

extend(Circle, Shape);

Circle.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  // Shape.prototype.duplicate.call(this);
  console.log('duplicate circle');
}

const c = new Circle(1);
const s = new Shape();
```

```javascript
// Method overriding
Shape.prototype.draw = function() {}
Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
    // Call the base implementation
    Shape.prototype.draw.call(this);

    // Do additional stuff here
}
```

## Polymorphism

Method overriding, which basically means re-implementing a method in a child object.

```javascript
function extend(Child, Parent) {
  Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent);
  Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
}

function Shape() {
}

Shape.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate');
}

function Circle() {
}

extend(Circle, Shape);

Circle.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate circle');
}

function Square() {
}

extend(Square, Shape);

Square.prototype.duplicate = function() {
  console.log('duplicate square');
}
const c = new Circle();
const s = new Square();

const shapes = [
  new Circle();
  new Square();
];

for (let shape of shapes) {
  shape.duplicate();
}
```

## When to Use Inheritance

1. Start with simple objects, and then if you see a number of these objects share similar features, then perhaps you can encapsulate those features inside of a generic object, and use inheritance. But remember, inheritance is not the only solution to enable code reuse. There is another technique called composition.

```javascript

function Animal() {
  eat() {};
  walk() {};
}

function Person() {}
extend(Person, Animal);

function Dog() {}
extend(Person, Animal);

function Fish() {}
extend(Person, Animal); // Hierarchy is broken as fish swims
```

On the top we should have, the animal object with the eat method. Under that we're going to have two objects, mammal and fish. Mammals can walk fish can swim. And then we can have person and dog derive from mammal and goldfish derive from fish.

As a result of introducing a new kind of animal, that is goldfish, you had to change our hierarchy, and now this hierarchy is more complex then what we had before. Don't create large inheritance hierarchies. One level of inheritance is fine.

Favor composition over inheritance.  So we can have three objects, like canWalk, canEat, and canSwim. Each of these objects are plain JavaScript objects, but with certain properties and methods. Now we want to have a person object,
To simply compose canWalk and canEat to create a person object. JavaScript, we can use mixing to achieve composition.

## Mixins

Use mixins to combine multiple objects and implement composition in JavaScript.

```javascript
const canEat = {
    eat: function() {
      console.log('eating');
    }
};

const canWalk = {
    walk: function() {
      console.log('walking');
    }
};

function Person() {}
Object.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk);

const person = new Person();
```

```javascript
const canEat = {
  eat: function() {}
};

const canWalk = {
  walk: function() {}
};

const canSwim = {
  walk: function() {}
};

function mixin(target, ...sources) {
    // Copies all the properties from all the source objects
    // to the target object.
    Object.assign(target, ...sources);
}

function Person() {}
mixin(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk);

function Fish() {}
mixin(Fish.prototype, canEat, canSwim);
```
