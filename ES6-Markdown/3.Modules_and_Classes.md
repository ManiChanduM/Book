# Modules and Classes

## Introduction

Helps us to make our code more modular and this has classes which are most easily accessible.

## Modules Setup

Traceur to compile the code from ES6 to ES5 and SystemJS to support the feature of modules.

```javascript
<script>
  System.import('./script.js');
</script>
```

## Module Basics

* We can export and import variables or functions from files.
* We can group the imports or exports if they belongs to same files.
* While we are exporting we are exporting the reference not the value of the variable.

```javascript
/* methods.js */
function sum(valueOne, valueTwo) {
  let total = valueOne + valueTwo;
  return total;
};

let defaultValue = 'Default Value';
let aliasValue = 'Alias Value';

export default defaultValue;
export { sum, aliasValue }
```

```javascript
import { sum } from './methods.js';
console.log(sum(10, 10));
```

## Imports and Exports syntax

We can export only a single varible as the default ```export``` and ```import``` in files, In import we can import with any name for default exported files as they are single elements.

We can set a alias name for any imported properties with ```as``` keyword.

We can import all the exports in one shot with universal selctor ```*``` and that will return an objet with properties as the number of exported items which are passed from the other file.

```javascript
import anyValue from './methods.js';
import { aliasValue as alias } from './methods.js';
import * as imported from './methods.js';

console.log(anyValue);
/* default variable is defaultValue */
console.log(alias);
/* This is assigned with a custom name in this imported file. */
console.log(imported); 
/* Return the objects which are exported in methods files. */
```

## Modules - Strict Mode and Global Scope

* Modules are always in Strict Mode (no need to define "use strict")
* Modules don't have a shared, global Scope. Instead each Module has its own Scope

## Class Basics

We can create blueprint very quickly with this class keyword. constructor is the reserved keyword for the class. We used to do this with function prototype creation.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello this is ' + this.name);
  }
};

let person = new Person('Mani Chandu');
person.greet();
```

## Classes and Prototypes

Constructor function has the same behaviour the prototype of the class and instance of it are same.

```javascript
console.log((person.__proto__) === Person.prototype); // true
```

## Inheritance

* We can inherite the properties and methods.
* If we extend a class and that class needs a constructor then we need to use ```super()``` as the parent has constructor.
* If we are having the method with same names in parent and child we can invoke them individually.
* If we specify ```this.methodName``` it will call the child method.
* If we specify ```super.methodName``` it will call the parent method.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('The animal name is ' + this.name + ' and its age is ' + this.age);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name);
    this.age = age;
  }
}

let dog = new Dog('Dog', 4);
dog.greet();
```

## Inheritance & Prototypes

* In the above example the prototype of dog is equal to ```Dog.Prototype```.
* In inheritance we will have a new class created for child but it will have all the properties & methods of the parent.

## Static Methods

If we want to use any method in a class without creating a object. We need to use ```static``` keyword.

By using ```static``` keyword we can have helper classes which have all the helper methods and those can be used within the project without creating the helper functions.

```javascript
class helper {
  static assertLogger() {
    console.assert(1 === 1, '[Error]: The condition what you checked is not equal');
  }
}

helper.assertLogger();
```

## Classes & Modules

We can ```export``` class and can use it with ```import```. So we can have single file for every class like other programming languages.

## Getters & Setters

* With getter and setter we can control the way it will assign and display the data.
* With getter and setter we can achieve a property called encapsulation.
* That is the data can't be accessed or assigned it will behaves as the private.

```javascript
class Events {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name.toUpperCase();
  }

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length > 2) {
      this._name = value;
    } else {
      console.log('Rejected');
    }
  }
}

let event = new Events('Birthday');
console.log(event.name);
event.name = 'Wedding';
console.log(event.name);
```

## Extending Built-in Objects

ES6 supports a feature called subclassing. This will take a build in objects of JavaScript and we can extend it with our own methods.

```javascript
class CovertableArray extends Array {
  convert() {
    let returnArray = [];
    this.forEach(value => returnArray.push('Converted' + value));
    return returnArray;
  }
}

let numberArray = new CovertableArray();
numberArray.push(1);
numberArray.push(2);
numberArray.push(3);

console.log(numberArray.convert());
```
