# Using Classes to create objects

## Introduction

* ES6 introduces the feature of the classes.
* TypeScript adds even more functionality to classes.

## Creating Classes and Class Properties

* With classes we can set properties and methods.
* Helps us to create new blueprints out of objects very easily.
* public is default and can be accessible from outside.
* private is not natively available in JavaScript.
* protected property is available to the inherited child where as private is not.

## Class Methods and Access Modifiers

* We can make properties of the class as private or protected members this applies to methods as well.
* These kind of properties with access modifiers can be accessed within the class.

```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string;
  private age: number;
  protected gender: string;

  constructor(name: string, public hobbies: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  setAgeAndGender(age: number, gender: string): void {
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }

  getAgeAndGender() {
    console.log(`Age: ${this.age}`);
    console.log(`Hobbies: ${this.hobbies}`);
  }
}

let person = new Person('Mani Chandu', 'Badminton');
person.setAgeAndGender(25, 'Male');
person.getAgeAndGender();

// Age: 25
// Hobbies: Badminton
```

## Inheritance

* With the extends keyword after the class name we can extend any class.
* The class which got extended will have all the properties of the parent class.
* If we overwrite the class properties that will be applied. Native class will have higher priority then the inherited class.

```typescript

class Chandu extends Person {
  name = 'Mani Chandu';
  hobbies = 'Programming';
}

let chandu = new Chandu('Chandu', 'Badminton');

console.log(chandu);

/*
hobbies: 'Programming'
name: 'Mani Chandu'
*/
```

## Inheritance and Constructor

* If we want to have a constructor method in a inherited class we need to provide the ```super()```
* Super method will refers as the constructor for the parent class.

```typescript

class Chandu extends Person {

  constructor(hobbies: string) {
    super('chandu', hobbies);
  }
}

let chandu = new Chandu('Programming');
console.log(chandu);
// hobbies: 'Programming'
// name: 'chandu'
```

## Inheritance Wrap Up

* The properties which have the access specifiers as public and protected are accessible in the extended class.
* Private properties are not accessible for the extended classes.

```typescript
class Chandu extends Person {

  constructor(hobbies: string) {
    super('chandu', hobbies);
    this.gender = 'Male';
  }
}

let chandu = new Chandu('Programming');
console.log(chandu);
```

## Getters and Setters

* We can check the condition before assigning properties.
* We can transform or do some checks before returning the properties using getters and setters.

```typescript
class Plant {
  private _species = 'Default';

  get species(): string {
    return this._species.toUpperCase();
  }

  set species(value: string) {
    if (value.length < 3) {
      this._species = 'Default';
    } else {
      this._species = value;
    }
  }

let plant = new Plant();

console.log(plant.species); // DEFAULT
plant.species = 'AB';
console.log(plant.species); // DEFAULT
plant.species = 'Climber';
console.log(plant.species); // CLIMBER
```

## Static Properties and Methods

* A way which we can able to use members of class without instantiation.

```typescript
class Helpers {
  static PI = 3.14;
  static circumference(diameter: number): number {
    return this.PI * diameter;
  }
}

console.log(2 * Helpers.PI); // 6.28
console.log(Helpers.circumference(8)); // 25.12
```

## Abstract Classes

* Abstract class needs to be inherited.
* It provides a base class in cases where you know that you will need such a general blueprint
* Bundle some general functionality or logic in this abstract base class.

* Abstract methods wont have body but it will make a method to be define in the given structure in a class.

```typescript
abstract class Project {
  name = 'Project Name';
  budget = 1000;

  calcBudget(budget: number): number {
    return budget * 2;
  }

  abstract changeProjectName(name: string): void;
}

class ITProject extends Project {
  changeProjectName(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

let newProject = new ITProject();
console.log(newProject); // budget: 1000 name: "Project Name"
setTimeout(function () {
  newProject.changeProjectName('TypeScript');
  console.log(newProject); // budget: 1000, name: 'TypeScript'
}, 5000);

```
