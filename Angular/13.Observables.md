# Observables

## What is Observable

* An Observable is basically thought as a Data Source
* In Angular we are importing the Observables from Rxjs package.
* Observable follows a pattern that has Observable and Observer in between a stream of timeline.
* Eventually the observable will emit data packets over the stream.
* Observer has three methods to handel the data packages. Data, Error and Completion.
* Few Observable will never get completed example a observable which triggers on click of a button.

## Angular 6 and RxJS 6

* Angular and RxJS are having a good connection. These version numbers are in sync.
* RxJS If we want to use the older syntax we can install the older rxjs-compact package.

## Analyzing a Built-in Angular Observable

* Router will implement the observables with params for fetching URL links.
* When we are placing a subscribe method on the params we are actually in the part of observer.
* Observable data source will be emitted by the Angular when we click the routerLink.

## Building & Using a First Simple Observable

* We can setup a observable with a timer and subscribe to its changes.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
    const myNumber = interval(1000);
    myNumber.subscribe(
      (value: number) => {
        console.log(value);
      }
    );
  }

}

```

## Building & Using a Custom Observable from Scratch

* We can build our own observable which expects a observer as the params as this will be served when we subscribe

```typescript
ngOnInit() {

  const myObservable = new Observable((observer: Observer<string>) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      observer.next('First Package');
    }, 2000);
    setTimeout(() => {
      observer.next('Second Package');
    }, 4000);
    setTimeout(() => {
      observer.complete();
    }, 5000);
    setTimeout(() => {
      observer.error('Error');
    }, 6000);
  });

  myObservable.subscribe(
    (packet: string) => {
      console.log(packet);
    },
    (error: string) => {
      console.error(error);
    },
    () => {
      console.log('Completed');
    }
  );
  }
```

## Unsubscribe

* We need to unsubscribe from the observable which are subscribed.
* As this will not get destroyed if we navigated to other component and this will create a memory leak.
* It is always recommended to unsubscribe the subscriptions.

```typescript
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  myNumberSubscription: Subscription;
  myObservableSubscription: Subscription;

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.myNumberSubscription.unsubscribe();
    this.myObservableSubscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

## Using Subjects to Pass AND Listen to Data

* Convenient way of creating observables this acts like subscriber and subscription.
* If we want to use event emitter for cross component communication in that place we can use this.

```typescript
/* users.service.ts */
export class UsersService {
  userActivated = new Subject();
}

/* user.component.ts */
onActivate() {
  this.usersService.userActivated.next(this.id);
}

/* app.component.ts */
ngOnInit() {
  this.usersService.userActivated.subscribe(
    (id: number) => {
      if (id === 1) {
        this.user1Activated = true;
        this.user2Activated = false;
      } else if (id === 2) {
        this.user1Activated = false;
        this.user2Activated = true;
      }
    }
  );
}

```

## Understanding Observable Operators

* We have many operators available on RxJS Observable.
* This operators can able to transform the data when we are still inside the observables.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
 const myNumberMap = interval(1000).pipe(
      map((value: number) => {
        return value * 2;
      })
    );

this.myNumberMapSubscription = myNumberMap.subscribe(
  (value: number) => {
    console.log(value);
  });
}
```

## RxJS 6 without rxjs-compact

* If we want to setup any updated angular project want to run with old syntax of rxjs library.
* We need to install the rxjs-compact from npm.
