* In this scenario we need open up the developer console.
* We will be provided with the error line of the bundled files.
* But the error message which is shown will give the clue in which file or what operation is failing.

* SourceMaps are made available by Angular CLI during development process.
* This helps us to navigate to the typescript file and put the debug point to debug code.
* We can access sourcemaps in the Sources tab and we need to open the folder which is named as .
* This will have the exact file structure what we are seeing during the development.
