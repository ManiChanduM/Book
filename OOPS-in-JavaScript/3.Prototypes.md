# Prototypes

## Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming that enables an object to take on the properties and methods of another object. And this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application.

We refer parent class as base class or super class. Child class as direct class or sub class.

We can say inheritance as a IS-A relationship. For example we can say circle IS-A shape.

Now this is the classical definition of inheritance. But as you know, in JavaScript, we don't have classes, we only have objects. So that's when prototypical inheritance comes in the picture.

## Prototypes and Prototypical Inheritance

Every object has properties and methods, like constructor property which references the function that was used to construct or create that object. Prototype is essentially a parent of this object. Prototype is just a regular object in memory. Every object has a prototype or a parent, except the root object.

JavaScript engine first looks for that property or method first on the object itself. If it can't find it, then it looks at the prototype for that object. Again, if it can find that member, it will look at the prototype of that object all the way upto the root object which we call objectBase.

```javascript
let x = {};
let y = {};

console.log(x.__proto__); // Prints the prototype of x

console.log(y.__proto__);

Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === Object.getPrototypeOf(y); // true, as they both got constructed from Object
```

## Multi-level Inheritance

Objects created by a given constructor will have the same prototypes.

For example let us declare a array and a circle object.

```javascript
// Constructor Function
function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
  this.draw = function() {
    console.log('draw');
  };
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
const myArray = []; // const array = new Array();

```

Prototype chain of myArray: myArray --> arrayBase --> objectBase  
Prototype chain of circle: circle --> Circle --> objectBase

## Property Descriptors

A for in loop or if we call object.keys we can only only see the direct members of the object but not the baseObject members. On baseObject configurable property is false.

```javascript
let person = { name: 'Mani Chandu' };
let objectBase = Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(objectBase);
console.log(descriptor); // enumerable: false

let anotherPerson = { name: 'Vigneswari' };

Object.defineProperty(anotherPerson, name, `{
  writable: false,
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: false,
}`)

anotherPerson.name = 'Default';
console.log(anotherPerson.name); // Vigneswari. As writable is false

Object.keys(anotherPerson); // []. As enumerable is false

delete anotherPerson.name;
console.log(anotherPerson.name); // Vigneswari. As configurable is false
```

## Constructor Prototypes

Objects created by a given constructor will have the same prototypes.

```javascript
// Constructor Function
function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
  this.draw = function() {
    console.log('draw');
  };
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
console.log(circle.__proto__ === Circle.prototype); // true
```

## Prototype vs. Instance Members

```javascript
function Circle(radius) {
  // Instance members
  this.radius = radius;

  this.move = function() {
    this.draw();
    console.log('move');
  }
}

// Prototype members
Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
  console.log('draw');
  // this.move(); // We can even access the instance members as well
}

Circle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return 'Circle with radius ' + this.radius;
}

const c1 = new Circle(1);
const c2 = new Circle(2);
```

Instead of creating the draw method in memory for twice we have declared that as a prototype method. We can able to call instance members from prototypes and vice versa.

## Iterating Instance and Prototype Members

```javascript
function Circle(radius) {
  // Instance members
  this.radius = radius;

  this.move = function() {
    console.log('move');
  }

  const c1 = new Circle(1);
}

// Prototype members
Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
  console.log('draw');
}

// Returns instance
console.log(Object.keys(c1));

// Returns all members (instance + property)
for (let key in c1) {
  console.log(key);
}

c1.hasOwnProperty('draw'); // false
```

## Avoid Extending the Build-in Objects

Don't modify the object which we don't own.

```javascript
Array.prototype.shuffle = function() {
  // ...
}

const array = [];
array.shuffle();
```
