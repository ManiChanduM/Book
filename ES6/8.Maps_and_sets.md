# Maps and Sets

## Introduction

Maps and Sets are the two new kinds of the collections in ES6.

## Map - Creation & Adding Items

Map is a collection which stores the key values.
So by keys we can identify, retrieve and manage.
We can create a map in two ways.

Initially we need to assign a let deck = new Map()
Later use set method by passing key and values.

```javascript
let cardAce = {
  name: 'Ace of spades'
}

let cardKing = {
  name: 'King of Clubs'
}

let deck = new Map();
deck.set('as', cardAce);
deck.set('kc', cardKing);

let deck = new Map([['as', cardAce], ['kc', cardKing]]);
```

## Maps - Managing Items

To set a key in map we need to use set method by passing key and value ```nameOfMap('key' value);```

To retrieve the map we need to use get method by passing key. ```nameOfMap.get('key');```

If we reassign an key which is already existing then it will overwrite the value.

To delete a single set we need to use delete method with key. ```nameOfMap.delete('key');```

To clear the complete set we need to use clear method. ```nameOfMap.clear()```

```javascript
console.log(deck);
deck.set('as', cardAce);
console.log(deck.size);

console.log(deck.get('as'));

deck.delete('as');
console.log(deck.size);

deck.clear();
console.log(deck.size);
```

## Looping through Maps

We can get all the keys ```nameOfMap.keys()``` returns iterator for of loop can print.

We can even print the value ```nameOfMap.values()``` return iterator for of loop can print.

We can print the key and values as a entries with ```nameOfMap.entries()``` with for of loop
otherwise the same can be achieved with normal for of loop

```javascript
let alphabetNumber = new Map();
alphabetNumber.set(1, 'a');
alphabetNumber.set(2, 'b');
alphabetNumber.set(3, 'c');
alphabetNumber.set(4, 'd');

console.log(alphabetNumber);
console.log(alphabetNumber.keys());
keysIterator = alphabetNumber.keys();

for (key of keysIterator) {
  console.log(key);
}

let mapValues = alphabetNumber.values();

for (value of mapValues) {
  console.log(value);
}

let mapEntries = alphabetNumber.entries();

for (entry of mapEntries) { // entry of alphabetNumber
  console.log(entry);
}
```

## WrapUp

If we want to store the key value pair ideally we need to use objects,
but with maps we can set that using arrays like structure and we can loop over them. we can access with key or value and we can have only one value for a key.

## WeakMap

Weak references as the entires for the map.

Garbage Collection: This will identifies which objects are not used while running the code and that will be cleared from the memory.

Looping is not possible as JavaScript will handel garbage collection by freeing the memory of objects which are not in use.

.get works
To access the value we need to pass the .get(keyObject);

```javascript
let objKeyA = { a: 1 }
let objKeyB = { b: 2 }

let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(objKeyA, 'Value-1');
weakMap.set(objKeyB, 'Value-2');

console.log(weakMap.get(objKeyA));
```

## Sets

Holds a list of values which are unique. We can assign values with ```add()```

```javascript
let exampleSet = new Set();
exampleSet.add(1);
exampleSet.add(2);
exampleSet.add(3);
```

## Managing Items

* We can delete a value.
* We can clear the whole value.
* We can check whether there or not with has()

```javascript
exampleSet.delete(3);
exampleSet.clear()
exampleSet.has(1); // false
```

## Looping through sets

If we try to print both the key and value using entries, we will get both key and values as the same value.

As the values of sets are always unique so the keys and values are same.

We can get only keys or values ```keys()``` or ```values()```

```javascript
let alphabetsSets = new Set();
alphabetsSets.add('a');
alphabetsSets.add('b');
alphabetsSets.add('c');

let alphabetsSetsEntries = alphabetsSets.entries();

for (alphabet of alphabetsSetsEntries) {
  console.log(alphabet);
}

let alphabetsSetsKeys =  alphabetsSets.keys();
let alphabetsSetsValues =alphabetsSets.values();
```

## Sets Wrap Up

We can insert only uniques value and handled all the operation on additions for unique values.

## The WeakSet

Stores only objects. As they can garbage collected.
This is enumerable we can't loop through values.
It wont add two object which holds same memory block pointer.
Same  object cannot be added twice.
```has()```, ```add()``` and ```delete()``` are available

```javascript
let a = {a:1}
let b = {b:1}

let exampleWeakSet = new WeakSet();
exampleSet.add(a);
exampleSet.add(b);

console.log(exampleSet.has(b));
```
