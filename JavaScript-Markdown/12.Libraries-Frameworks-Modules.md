# Libraries Frameworks and Modularity

So far we learned the basics of JavaScript, but we will use libraries or frameworks in our projects.
We would like have different modules individually and import it whenever we needed and bunch all at final deployment.
This feature is not natively availble by JavaScript.

## Libraries and jQuery

jQuery has a lot of helper function which made very easy to accomplish many tasks.

## Frameworks

Single Page Applications: Everything needs to be handeled with JavaScript and frameworks takes the advantage of handling entire app development.

## Writing a Modular Code

* If we splited any app to have multiple JavaScript modules (files) based on there features then we need to import all such features in
a hierarchy which there are depended and it is a tough job.
* This task can be better handeled with It would be good if we import and export modules in JavaScript
* These tools will helps us to have import and export modules around project.
* During the build time they will import all this files to one file in a correct order and create a bundel.js which contains all JavaScript code
what a project requires.
