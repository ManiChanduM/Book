# ES6 Modules

## Modules

We should split our code into multiple files, and we call each of these files a module. This gives us a number of benefits.

First is that we can increase the maintainability of our application because our code is better organized.

Second is that we get the chance to reuse one or more of these modules in different parts of an application or in different applications.

Third, is that we can abstract code, so we can apply abstraction principle, which means we can hide some of the complexity in a module, and only expose the essentials.

## CommonJS Modules

```javascript
// circle.js

// Implementation Details
const _radius = new WeakMap();

// Public Interface
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    _radius.set(this, radius);
  }

  draw() {
    console.log('Circle with radius ' + _radius.get(this));
  }
}

module.exports = Circle;
```

```javascript
// index.js

const Circle = require('./circle');

const c = new Circle(10);
c.draw();
```

## ECMAScript6 Modules

```javascript
// circle.js

// Implementation Details
const _radius = new WeakMap();

// Public Interface
export class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    _radius.set(this, radius);
  }

  draw() {
    console.log('Circle with radius ' + _radius.get(this));
  }
}
```

```javascript
// index.js

import { Circle } from './circle.js';

const c = new Circle(10);
c.draw();
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## ES6 Tooling

Transpiler: Transpiler is the combination of two words. Translator and Compiler. Basically, it's a tool that we give it our modern JavaScript code, and it will cover our JavaScript code into code all of our browsers can understand. Earlier I showed you Babel. Babel is an example of a very popular transpiler for modern JavaScript

Bundler: Module bundler is responsible for combining all our JavaScript files into a single file, which we call a bundle.

## Babel

```shell
npm init --yes
npm install babel-cli@6.26.0 --save-dev
npm install babel-core@6.26.0 --save-dev
npm install babel-preset-env@1.6.1 --save-dev
```

Babel CLI is Babel's command line interface, this is the tool that we run from the command line, like npm. So we run
the command line, and give it the name of our JavaScript file, and then
it will convert or compile that JavaScript code.  

Babel-core is basically the core of Babel where all the logic for transpiring code is implemented.  

Babel-preset we have a plugin for every new JavaScript feature starting from ES6, so let's say you want to use let and const in ES6, there's a plugin for that. Every new feature in ES6 and newer versions has a corresponding plugin. Preset is basically the combination of all these plugins, so it understands all the new features in JavaScript starting from ES6.

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "babel": "babel --presets env index.js -o build/index.js"
  }
```

```shell
npm run babel
```

## Webpack

```shell
npm install -g webpack-cli
npx webpack-cli init --auto
npm run build
```
