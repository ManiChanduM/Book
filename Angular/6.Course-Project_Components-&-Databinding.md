# Course Project Components and Data binding

## Adding Navigation with Event Binding and ngIf

* We used the *ngIf two show and hide two pages from the header section.
* We emitted the event on which item it got clicked and in app.component.html we used *ngIf

## Passing Recipe Data with Property Binding

* We created recipe-item which shows each item in detail.
* recipe-list will hold a button with new recipe and recipe-item.
* recipe-item will be looped with *ngFor for each item.
