# Reflect API

## Introduction

* Is a meta programming corner it gives us tools to evaluate a code.
* Has Build in static methods like create object and properties, config properties, It has three advantage.
* Bundles all the features into single api. So we have cleaner and quicker access.
* New things and features which are not available before. Together Proxy API it work very well.

### Meta Programming

Meta Programming means that you’re able to change (parts of) the behavior of the underlying language – JavaScript in this case. This of course is a powerful feature as it allows you to influence the way your code is executed.

The Reflect API (like Symbols and Proxies) are important
additions which help you with Meta Programming – something that wasn’t
really possible in JavaScript before.

## Creating Objects with Reflect.construct()

We can create object with reflect api using ```Reflect.construct('Class or Constructor Function')```, ```['values']```, setCustomProtorype)
We can set the a custom prototype the same can be achieved with ```object.create()```

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class TopObject {
  constructor() {
    this.age = 25;
  }
}

let person = Reflect.construct(Person, ['Mani Chandu'], TopObject);

console.log(person.__proto__ == TopObject.prototype); // true
```

## Calling Functions with Reflect.apply()

We can call a method of a object with reflect api and we can even set what this refer to and can pass additional arguments.

Here we can change the this keyword which it is pointing to. by specifying the second parameter

```javascript
class PersonApply {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet(params) {
    console.log(params);
    console.log('Hello I am ' + this.name);
  }
}

let personApply = Reflect.construct(PersonApply, ['Mani Chandu']);

// personApply.greet();
Reflect.apply(personApply.greet, personApply, ['params']);
// Reflect.apply(personApply.greet, {name: 'Reena'}, ['params']);
```

## Reflect and Prototypes

We can check the prototype either by ```__proto__``` or ```Reflect.getPrototype(object);```

We can set the new prototype using the Reflect API

```javascript
console.log(Reflect.getPrototypeOf(person) == TopObject.prototype);
let proto = {
  hobbies: 'badminton'
}

Reflect.setPrototypeOf(personApply, proto);

console.log(Reflect.getPrototypeOf(personApply));
```

## Reflect.construct(), apply() and Prototypes Interaction

```Reflect.construct()``` can create objects out of class.

```apply()``` can change the this to what it refers to takes in ```object.methodName```, ```thisRefers```, ```[arguments]```

```setPrototype``` can change the base prototype

These all features are available in different locations in javascript Reflect API is a centralized repository where all these methods are available in one single place.

Getting the value and changing how it behaves is the meta programming

## Accessing Properties with Reflect

Getters and setter works the same way with Reflect API
```Reflect.set('object', 'key', 'value', receiver)```

With get we can send the external objects to use them inside object.

We can change the external objects values with receivers.

```Reflect.has()``` will check the property exists or not.

```javascript
Reflect.get(person, 'name');
Reflect.get(person, 'hobbies', 'badminton');

class PersonReceiver {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this._name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(value) {
    this._name = value;
  }
}

let mom = {
  _name: 'mom'
}

let personReceiver = new PersonReceiver;
console.log(Reflect.get(personReceiver, 'name', mom));
Reflect.set(personReceiver, 'name', 'Mani Chandu', mom);
console.log(Reflect.get(personReceiver, 'name', mom));

console.log(Reflect.has(person, 'name'));
```

## Analyzing Objects with Reflect.ownKeys()

We can get the list of properties like a array.

```javascript
console.log(Reflect.ownKeys(person));
```

## Creating & Deleting Properties with Reflect

As ES5 define property we can set the properties for objects using reflect

```javascript
console.log(person);
Reflect.defineProperty(person, 'hobbies', {
  value: ['badminton', 'computer']
})

console.log(person.hobbies);
Reflect.deleteProperty(person, 'hobbies');
```

## Preventing Object Extensions & Wrap Up

We can prevent a extension to stop being extended further.
We can even check whether a object is blocked or not.

```javascript
console.log(Reflect.isExtensible(person)); Reflect.preventExtensions(person);
```
