# Introduction

ECMAScript6/ES2015 This is a next version of JavaScript. With right tools we can use these features in all the browsers.

## JavaScript ES5 vs ES6

We will use transpire to make ES6 code to get executed on all browsers.
Transpires will take ES6 code and converts the codes to ES5 so that can be run in all the browsers.

## Course Format

JSBin will be used as the development environment for this whole course.

## Using ES6 Today

* Transpire babel
* Module Loader Webpack or SystemJS as pure module loader Servers
