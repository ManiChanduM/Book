# Symbols

## Introduction

Part of meta data tools which are introduced by ES6, Symbols are the new primitive types. They provide a unique identifier.

These will have a unique identifier and we can't access a symbol by for-in loop.

If we want to create a object with a property which definitely holds a unique value then we can use symbols.

## Symbols Basics

* We can assign a symbol with Symbol keyword. Symbol take identifier for debug reason.
* We can declare a symbol within a object [symbol]. So we can store the meta program info.
* type of Symbol is symbol, While we loop through the object it wont print the symbol.
* We can store some meta programming information which doesn't come in between loop, but we can access it if we need it.

```javascript
let symbol = Symbol('test');
let anotherSymbol = Symbol('test');

console.log(symbol); // Symbol(test)
console.log(typeof symbol); // symbol
console.log(symbol == anotherSymbol); // false

var person = {
  [symbol]: new Date,
  name: 'Mani Chandu',
}

console.log(person); // { name: 'Mani Chandu' }
console.log(person[symbol]);
```

## Shared Symbols

* We can have symbols same id for two or more symbols.
* We can also call the symbol with this id.
* To create a share symbol we need to use for method.

```javascript
let symbolOne = Symbol.for('age');
let symbolTwo = Symbol.for('age');
console.log(symbolOne === symbolTwo); //true

let anotherPerson = {
  name: 'Vigneswari'
}

function createAgeSymbol(age) {
  let ageSymbol = Symbol.for('age');
  anotherPerson[ageSymbol] = age;
}

createAgeSymbol(25);
console.log(anotherPerson[symbolOne]);
/* 25 We accessed the symbol out side of its scope. */
```

## Advantages of unique IDs / Symbols

* If we have a two properties with same name and one out of that is symbol.
* It won't get related to first variable. So this is the advantage of the unique identifier.

```javascript
let globalAgeSymbol = Symbol.for('currentAge');
let chandu = {
  firstName: 'Mani Chandu',
  lastName: 'Medidhi',
  age: 25
}

function setAgeSymbol(currentAge) {
  let localAgeSymbol = Symbol.for('currentAge');
  chandu[localAgeSymbol] = currentAge;
}

setAgeSymbol(25.1);
console.log(chandu.age); // 25
console.log(chandu[globalAgeSymbol]);
```

## Well Know Symbols

* We can change the type of the objects with ```[Symbol.toStringTag]```
* Well known symbols
* Primitive Symbol A unique id

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers + 1); // [1,2,31]

numbers[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => 999; console.log(numbers + 1); // 1000
```
