# Functions (Advanced)

## Closures

Functions which are defined in another function.

Useful when we have call backs in the functions. Call back is aware of the environment.

We are able to store the environment state of the variable when it is called. Whenever we invoke it uses value we stored at the time of initialize.

```javascript
function generator(input) {
  var number = input;
  return function () {
    return number * 2;
  }
}

var calc = generator(900);
var calcAnother = generator(512);
console.log(calc());
console.log(calcAnother());
```

## IIFS

Functions which are invoked automatically when the code is executed.
Local scoped variables are used in this time.
We can also pass the args

```javascript
(function (number) {
  var input = number;
  return console.log(input * 2);
})(512);
```

## Build in methods properties with functions

* ```arguments``` inside a function can access all the arguments which are passed to the function.

* We can also find the name of the function with ```functionName.name```
This helps to know the name when we assigned a variable to function and executing the variable. Anonymous function .name return ''

* Length on function will tell how many arguments it expects. This helps to find out if we are looping through a array of function how many variable to be assigned to it.

* The bind() method, which allows you to set to what this should refer to inside the function call.

```javascript
function message(msg) {
  console.log(msg);
  console.log(arguments); // msg, name
}

var callThis = message;
callThis('Hello', 'Again');
console.log('FunctionName: ' + callThis.name); // message
console.log(callThis.length); // 1

var name = 'Anna';
var obj = {
  name: 'Max'
};
function printName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

printName(); // Anna printName.bind(obj)(); // Max ```
