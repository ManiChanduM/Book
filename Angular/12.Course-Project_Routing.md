# Course Project Routing

## Planning the General Structure

* We are going to add the separate router links for shopping-list and recipe section.
* We need to create a new component recipe-edit.
* Either the RecipeDetails or RecipeEdit component needed to be loaded.

## Setting up Routes

* We need to setup the routes for navigation bar.
* Add routerLinkActive to style the active link.
* Remove any href tags to prevent reloading the app.

## Child Routes
