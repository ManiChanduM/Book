# Objects

## Objects Basics and Literal Notation

This module discuss about the creation and characteristics of the objects.
Objects are created to group multiple variable of similar category to single element instead of creating many variables. Using a key value pair format.
Objects are reference type so when ever we change a clone of it that will even update the other objects too. This maintain a good sync or state.

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Mani Chandu',
  age: '25',
  details: {
    location: 'Visakhapatnam'
  },
  hobbies: ['Badminton'],
  greet: function () {
    console.log('Hello!')
  }
}

console.log(person.details.location);
```

objects keys can be declared with string quotes so we can use hype's in there name.

To access such objects we need to use array type selection.

To access a key which is stored inside a variable we can exclude the quote in ```[]```

```javascript
var car = {
  'modal-name': 'Ciaz'
}
console.log(car['modal-name']);

var modal = 'modal-name';
console.log(car[modal]);
```

## Properties and this

We can reassign any properties of the object.

```javascript
person.details.location = 'Bangalore';
```

If we want to access the properties of the object inside it. we need to use this keyword to point the properties of the object.

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Mani Chandu',
  age: 25,
  details: {
    location: 'Visakhapatnam'
  },
  hobbies: ['Badminton'],
  greet: function () {
    console.log('Hello! ' + this.name)
  }
}

person.greet();
```

## Alternative way creating a object: Using the object constructor

We can instantiate a object with new Object();
Object is an Object type, which will be shipped with javascript by default.
To assign values to objects we use dot notation declaration method

```javascript
var person = new Object();
person.name = 'Mani Chandu';
person.age = 25
```

## Objects are Reference Types Refresher

If we have two different object holding the same value and we tried comparing the values of both the objects we get false.
As JavaScript will try to compare the pointers which are pointing to the memory location not the values of the memory location.

```javascript
var object = { name: 'Mani Chandu' };
var anotherObject = object;
console.log(object == anotherObject); // true
```

## Object.create()

With this type of object creation we can set the what prototype this object should handel.
Prototypes are the kind of inheritance in JavaScript.
Every object will have a default prototype as Object.prototype this is the root prototype.

```javascript
var anotherPerson = Object.create(person);
anotherPerson.name = 'Vigneswari';
console.log(anotherPerson.age); // 25
```

## ProtoType Introduction

By Default every object has a root prototype we can access that by a unsafe method.

```javascript
console.log(Object.__prototype__);
```

this is available by browser.
So we can see a live example of a prototype method on every object is.

```javascript
person.toString();
```

We can also declare our own prototypes

```javascript
Object.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello from prototype');
};
```

**ProtoTypeChain**
So when we have called a method or property which is not available on the object then JavaScript will look at.

* ProtoType of the object if it was inherited by any.
* Then ProtoType of ProtoType
* ProtoType of ProtoType

## Prototype in Action

Prototype chain will work even for the methods of the prototype if we have a this keyword inside it.

```javascript
Object.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
}

var person = {
  name: 'Mani Chandu'
}

var anotherPerson = new Object(person);
person.greet(); // Hello Mani Chandu
anotherPerson.greet(); //  Hello Mani Chandu

anotherPerson.name = 'Vigneswari';
anotherPerson.greet(); // Hello fVigneswari
```

## Prototype summary

These are only JavaScript kind of inheritance as they will create the blue print so we can reuse in the other object if it has the prototype.

```javascript
anotherPerson.__prototype__ == person; // true
anotherPerson.__prototype__.__prototype__ == Object.prototype; // true
Object.getPrototype(anotherPerson) == person; // true
```

## Constructor Functions

This is the forth way of creating the objects.

In this approach we can define the prototype (blueprint) of the object.
JavaScript creates prototype for the objects which are created with constructor approach.

So we can declare custom prototypes for only selected variables not to the global Object.prototype.

The concept of having the inheritance of the methods and blueprint of the object can be achieved.

```this``` in global refers to the window object. when this is inside the object property it access the object value from its key. when we use this in the constructor function key. that will refer to the invoking object.

We can check the instance of a constructor functions with ``instanceof`` keyword.

```javascript
function PersonConstructor() {
  this.name = 'Mani Chandu'
  this.greet = function () {
    console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
  }
};

PersonConstructor.prototype.greetGeneral = function () {
  console.log('Hello');
}

PersonConstructor.prototype.name = 'Default';

var personConstructor = new PersonConstructor();

console.log(personConstructor);
console.log(personConstructor.__proto__ == PersonConstructor.prototype); // true
personConstructor.name = 'Chandu'

var anotherPerson = new PersonConstructor();

personConstructor.greet(); // Hello Chandu
anotherPerson.greet(); // Hello Mani Chandu
console.log(personConstructor instanceof PersonConstructor); // true
```

## Contructor Function and arguments

These will have the default function behaviors so we can pass them as arguments. Later this can help to build object with default properties
we can assign the value while creating the object.

```javascript
function PersonConstructorArgs(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

var personConstructorArgs = new PersonConstructorArgs('Chandu', '25');
console.log(personConstructorArgs); // {name: 'Chandu', age: 25}
```

## Object Creation and prototype summary

Constructors can create the blueprints of the objects
Prototypes are the kind of javascript inheritance which sit on the higher level on object.

Types of creating an object

1. Literal Notation basic and very simple

  ```javascript
  var person = { name: 'Mani Chandu' }
  ```

2. Construction function of object

  ```javascript
  var person = new Object();
  ```

3. Create method of the object

  ```javascript
  var person = Object.create(null);
  /* Doesn't even have the object.prototype or we can set any type of choice. */
  ```

4. Constructor Function with arguments

  ```javascript
  var Person = function (name) {
     this.name = name;
     };
  
  var person = new Person('Mani Chandu').
  ```

## The this keyword and why it might behaves strangely

It refer to this object which ever is calling. Generally refers to the left element of the dot where it is being called.

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log(this);
}

foo(); // Prints the windows object

object = {
  objectFunction: foo
}

object.objectFunction(); // This will prints the object
```

We can alter the this functionality to refer any item with bind function

```javascript
object.objectFunction.bind(this); // This will prints the windows object
var person = { name: 'Mani Chandu' };

object.objectFunction.bind(person); // This will print the person object
```

## Handling the this with bind, call and apply

**Bind**: These all three are the helper functions. Bind will take the object but we can decide when to invoke

**Call**: This will call by immediately with functions as arguments in it.

**Apply**: This will get called exactly like call but we need to pass args in array.

```javascript
function foo(message) {
  console.log(message);
  console.log(this);
}

foo(); // Prints the windows object

object = {
  objectFunction: foo
}
/* TODO: Correct the syntax */
person = { name: 'Mani Chandu' }
object.objectFunction.bind(person, 'hello')();

object.objectFunction.call(person, 'hello');

object.objectFunction.apply(person, ['hello']);
```

## Creating properties with define properties

We can set the properties of the objects with defineProperty method on objects which has many helper keys on value object.
value will set the value.
set will assign the value.
get will help to filter the value.
This property helps us to decide which value we can set and filter it before assign it to the properties.

```javascript
console.log('--> Define Property <--')
var account = {
  _name: 'Account Name',
  cash: '1000',
  withdraw: function (amount) {
    if (this.cash > amount) {
      this.cash -= amount;
      console.log('Available balance is ' + this.cash);
    } else {
      console.log('Insufficient Balance');
    }
  }
}

account.withdraw(500);

Object.defineProperty(account, 'deposit', {
  value: function (amount) {
    this.cash += amount;
    console.log('Available balance is ' + this.cash);
  }
})

account.deposit(500);

Object.defineProperty(account, 'name', {
  // value: 'Chandu',
  // writable: true,
  get: function () {
    return this._name;
  },
  set: function (name) {
    if (name == 'Chandu') {
      this._name = name;
    }
  }
})

account.name = 'Chandu';
console.log(account.name);
```

## Important build in methods and properties

We can delete any property on an object with delete keyword.
We can find a property exists on a object with in keyword which returns boolean.
We can loop through all the fields in object with in keyword. item prints labels / object[item] prints values.

```javascript
var bird = {
  name: 'Eagle',
  age: 5,
  gender: 'Male',
  flight: true
}

console.log('age' in bird); // True

delete bird.age;

for (var item in bird) { console.log(item); // Print keys name, gender, flight console.log(bird[item]);
// Prints the values 'Eagle', 'Male', true } ```
